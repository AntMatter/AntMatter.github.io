 <p style="font-family: 'Girassol', cursive;">Malachy Swonger</p>
 <p>I was raised in a small mining town nearly 10,000 ft high in the San Juan mountains. Living surrounded by nature and geography for most of my life has given me a unique view of the world, and a limitless outlook on life.</p>
 <p>My passion for photography started at a young age through photographing the wildlife and endless landscapes surrounding my home. After leaving the mountains for the deserts of Western Colorado, I began to photograph more urban scenes and statues.</p>
 <p>While I was in high school, I received the opportunity to visit El Salvador in Central America. While there, I had the opportunity to photograph the vast culture of the country through its wildlife and landmarks.</p>
 <p>I am currently based in Fort Collins, Colorado where I hope to continue to develop my photography with new experiences and opportunities.</p>
